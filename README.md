# Accenture (Forage) Virtual Internship Project

Welcome to the README for my virtual internship project at Accenture (Forage), where I had the opportunity to work with Social Buzz, a rapidly growing unicorn in the technology sector. Over a three-month Proof of Concept (POC) initiative, I was tasked with several pivotal objectives:

- **Comprehensive Examination of Big Data Utilization:** Analyzing Social Buzz's use of big data.
- **Strategies for a Successful Initial Public Offering (IPO):** Formulating strategies to ensure a successful IPO.
- **Analysis of Top 5 Content Categories:** Determining and analyzing the top 5 content categories on Social Buzz.

## Project Overview

With an expanding global footprint, Social Buzz faces the challenge of managing a vast influx of unstructured data, encompassing over 100,000 posts daily and 36,500,000 posts annually. To tackle this challenge, I followed a structured approach:

1. **Data Comprehension:** Thoroughly examined the available datasets.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Utilized Python, specifically pandas, for data cleaning, including removing unwanted columns and errors.
3. **Data Modeling:** Employed various techniques to analyze and merge the datasets.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored the datasets to derive actionable insights.

## Key Findings

My analysis revealed compelling findings, including:

- **Top Content Categories:** Identified the top five most popular content categoriesâ€”Animals, Food, Science, Technology, and Healthy Eating.
- **Content Format Impact:** Uncovered insights into the impact of content format (photo, audio, video, GIF) on user engagement, with recommendations to optimize content choices for maximum positive reactions.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis not only identifies key areas for content strategy enhancement but also provides actionable recommendations to drive positive user engagement on Social Buzz.
